Overall, I approached the debugging challenges by carefully examining the code and identifying the bugs, then fixing them by modifying the code and testing the changes. I also approached the user stories I needed to write from scratch by breaking them down into smaller tasks, then implementing each task one at a time. I tested each task thoroughly to ensure that it worked as expected and integrated it with the existing code.
